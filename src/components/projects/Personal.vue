                <p>This is a personal project that I thought of back in 2016 and never got around to building. Until now.</p>
                <p>I'm building it with a Vue frontend, and a Go backend with Mongodb</p>
                <p>DJmocracy is crowd sourced playlist generation that makes amateur DJs and house party hosts lives easier</p>
