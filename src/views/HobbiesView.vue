      <h1>This is where you'll really get to know me</h1>
      <p>If you know anything about me you'll know I'm super competitve, and that I love a good league.
      Some leagues I've been a part of include: bowling, disc golf, corn hole, and pinball. Yes, pinball.</p>

      <p>For outdoor activities we love to ski, rock climb, hike, fish, and camp. My weekends and vacation time belong to the mountains.</p>
      <p>I also have a nature photography page and we're big bird nerds. Can't go anywhere without the camera or a pair of binos just in case there's a new lifer out there!</p>
      <p>For my nerdy ventures I play video games (mostly League of Legends and random indie hits) and read Fantasy and Sci-Fi.
      Some of my favorite authors are Becky Chambers (don't sleep on the Wayfarer series), Brandon Sanderson, and Robin Hobb.</p>
