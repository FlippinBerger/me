    <h1>My technical skills and interests</h1>
    <!-- <h2>Favorite languages</h2> -->
    <h3>Rust</h3>
    <p>In my mind, Rust is the future of game development and any "intense" 
    computing. It is also a joy to work with once you get used to the borrow 
    checker. I find that the compile errors help me write code much better than 
    any other language I've spent any amount of time with.</p>
    <h3>Go</h3>
    <p>Go is still probably my most productive language. It is easy to read, 
    easy to write, easy to get shit done. Enough said. I have about 3 years of 
    production experience in Go.</p>
    <h3>Typescript</h3>
    <p>Typescript is mostly a language of necessity for me. But when I need to
    get something done on the front end, this is a no brainer. The type safety
    on top of the mature web frameworks like React and Vue is too nice to pass
    up when you find yourself on that side of the stack. I have about 4 years 
    experience with Typescript (mostly React, but some Node as well)</p>

    <!-- <h2>Favorite Tools</h2> -->
    <h3>Text Editor</h3>
    <p>Neovim all the way. I can't live without it anymore. You can find my
    lua dotfiles for my config
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FlippinBerger/nvim/">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Terminal</h3>
    <p>I was using iTerm2 for a long time because it had solid extra color support
    over the default Mac terminal app. I'm now giving Warp a go and absolutely
    loving it so far. I think I found a new boost to productivity :)</p>
    <h3>Version Control</h3>
    <p>I have git skills for anyone here wondering. I've used bitbucket a little bit
    but I'm a Github guy for sure.</p>
    <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
    <p>The three biggest areas I'm interested in are Game Dev, Developer Tooling 
    and Experience, and SaaS not necessarily in that order.</p>
    <p>That being said, I'd love to learn more way more about Web3 and the 
    different players there. I'm absolutely fascinated by 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization" target="_blank">DAOs</a>
    and the implications they could have for teams of the future.</p>
