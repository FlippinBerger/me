    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Chris and I am a backend-leaning full stack engineer with ~6 years of experience in industries ranging from office furniture to CRMs to Authenticity on the Internet.</h3>
    <h3>I'm an eclectic trifecta of super nerd, outdoorsy adventurer, and obsessive competitor.</h3>
    <h3>I collect hobbies like crows collect shiny objects. You never know what I'm going to be interested in next.</h3>
    <h3>My family consists of my beautiful and incredible wife, Audrey, who is a pediactric dentist, a very needy kitty named Maya, and an incredibly energetic doggo named Annie.</h3>
